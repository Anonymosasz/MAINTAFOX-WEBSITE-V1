### 4. **Admin Dashboard** (`app/admin/blog/page.tsx`)

  - **Approve**: Publish pending posts
  - **Reject**: Mark posts as rejected
  - **View**: Preview post
  - **Edit**: Modify post content
  - **Delete**: Permanently remove post
- Admin-only access control

### 5. **Type Definitions** (`types/blog.ts`)
- TypeScript interfaces for:
  - BlogPost
  - User
  - Comment (for future use)
- Type safety across the application

### 6. **Layout Integration** (`app/layout.tsx`)
